# Falar Portugues

:children_crossing: :bangbang:
> This is a personal training project, which is not meant to be deployed in a production environment. Therefore:
> - poor (or almost) no test coverage
> - no deployment or CI/CD strategy in place

## Run

```bash
cd falar
paket install
dotnet restore
dotnet built
dotnet run
```

A prompt should guide you from there. Have a good learning!
